Based on commit 3cc726cd5dc6b (tag: SendToPcBManufacturer) the following bugs are in the schematic and PCB layout (revision 1.0):

1. Pins for RGB LEDs are wrong
  The wrong footprint results in the green and blue LED pins to be switched.
  Workaround: Switch pins in software, switch resistor values for this colors. No PCB changes required.
  Schematic and PCB adjusted in revision 1.1

2. PowerOff signal is connected to JTAG JTDI pin and has an internal pull-up
  Beside no documentation has been found describing this behaviour, a high value can be measured on
  powerup for some microseconds. This would switch off the power supply immediately.
  Workaround: Decrease R8 to a value where the internal STM32 pull-up and R8 does not generate a voltage large enough
  for Q80 to open. 4.7kΩ will do. No PCB changes required.
  Schematic and PCB adjusted in revision 1.1

3. RV100 and J3 should be soldered from the bottom
  This allows to save height space in the case.
  Soldering from the bottom does not need any layout changes, however then the silk screen will be on the wrong side.
  No schematic and PCB adjustments are planned, as this not really an error.

4. RTC might have a wrong frequency due to an errata of the STM32F405
  According to the errata, the LSI might be wrong when PC13 toggles. PC13 is used to control the charger.
  No change planned - this pin is not toggled often and the RTC is optional and currently no usage is planned.
